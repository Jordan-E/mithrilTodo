# Mithril Vite Starter

[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) starter template to scaffold a new [Mithril](https://mithril.js.org/) project.

This is an unopinionated template; aside from Mithril and Vite, the rest of your project's tools are entirely up to you.

## npm scripts

* `npm run dev` - Starts the development server at port 3000
* `npm run build` - Builds the application
* `npm run preview` - Serves the build files locally at port 5000
